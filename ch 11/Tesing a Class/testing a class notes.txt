Testing a Class
    helpful to prove that your classes work correctly

    Variety of Assert Methods
    _______________________________________________________
    Method                  Use
    -------------------------------------------------------
    assertEqual(a,b)        Verify that a == b
    assertNotEqual(a,b)     Verity that a != b
    assertTrue(x)           Verify that x is True 
    assertFalse(x)          Verify that x is False 
    assertIn(item, list)    Verify that item is in list
    assertNotIn(item, list) Verify that item is not in list
    --------------------------------------------------------

    A Class to Test
        testing behavior of methods in classes

        Testing the AnonymousSurvery Class

        The setUp() method
        in test_survey.py we created a new instance of AnonymousSurvey in each test method & created new responses in each method

        setUp() - allows you to create these objects once and then use them in each of your test methods
            inlcude in TestCase class
            python runs setUp() before running each method stsrting with test_survey
            any object created in this method is available in each test method
            1 set of instances & attributes
                use them in alltest methods
