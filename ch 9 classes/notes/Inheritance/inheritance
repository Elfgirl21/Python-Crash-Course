if class working on is an specialized version of another class,
    can use inheritance

when one class inherits from another
    inheirts all attributes & methods

original - parent superclass
new - child  subclass
child class can inheirt any or all atributes and methods of parent's
    aslo free to define new attributes & methods
parent & child must be in same file, parent before child

override methods from the parent class
    if method in parent doesn't fit model in child class
    define a method in child (same name in parent) to override
        python will disregrd parent class method, only focus on child method

instances as attributes
when files becomes too lengthy by adding methods and attributes
    might recognize part of one class can be written as a separte class
    break larger classes into smaller classes that work together

Modeling real-world objects
    might have to torn apart and rewritten your classes when modeling real world object
    ex: move get_range() method from Battery to Electricar if it's manufacturer's entire line up
        or keep it in Battery if diff car models
