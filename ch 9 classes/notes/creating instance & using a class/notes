function of class is a method
__init__() method - special method that python runs automatically whenever 
    were create a new instance based on the Dog class
    convention of underscores is to prevent python's default method names from
        conflicting with your method names
    three parameters:
        self parameter is required in method def & comes first
            included b/c when python calls this method later (to create an instance of Dog)
            method call will automatically pass the self argument
            every method call associated w/ an instance automatically passes self,
            which is a reference to the instance itself
                gives individaul instance access to the attributes & methods in class
    other give 2 parameters when creating a instance in the class Dog case
    prefix self
        any variable prefixed with self is available to every method in the class
        & able to access these variable through any instance created from the class
        self.name = name - takes value associated w/ parameter name and assigns it to variable name
            then attached to the instance being created
        variables accessible through instances like this are called attributes
