#when you pass a list to a function, function gets direct access to the contents
#functions can also modifying lists
    #can changes to list inside function's body is permanent
#having functions in code makes it more efficient when to change code
#sometimes don't want function to modify list
    #passing the function a copy of the list, any changes done is only affecting the copy, not original
    #How to do that ---- function_name(list_name[:]) ---
#rule of thumb --- its more efficient for function to work with existing list instead of copy
    #it takes time and memory
    #only use copy if necessary
