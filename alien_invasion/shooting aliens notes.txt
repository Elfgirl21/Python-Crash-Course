sprite.groupcollide() - checks for collisions b/w mebers of two groups

returns dictionary of bullets and aliens - bullets keys, aliens value to those keys

collisions = pygame.groupcollide(
    self.bullets, self.aliens, True, True)
    compares position of a ll bullets in self.bullets and all aliens in self.aliens and identifies any that overlap
    when there's a overlap, groupcollide() adds a key-value pair to dictionary it returns
    2 true args tell pygame to delete the bullets and aliens that have collided
