URL pattern - describes the way the URL is laid out, tells Django what to look for when matching a browser request
    with a site URL so it knows which page to returns
    Each URL then maps to a particular view

view - function rerieves and processes data needed for that page, often renders the page using a template

template - contains overall structure of the pages

Mapping a URL
    home page - base URL people use to access the project
    
    path() - maps URLs to views

    dot in the line (from . import views) tells python to to import views.py module from the same directory as the current urls.py module

    app_name variable helps Django distinguish current urls.py file from files of same name in other apps w/in project

    urlpatterns - variable, list of individual pages that can be requested from app_name

    Actual URL pattern - call to path(): taks 3 args-1) string arg that helps Django route the current request properly 
                                                        searches for a match in URL patterns variable define & returns error if can't find
                                                        empty string '' matches base URL 
                                                    2) specifies which function to call in views.py
                                                        When requested URL matches pattern (urlpatterns)
                                                        Django calls index() in views.py
                                                    3) provides name index for this URL pattern, refer to it in other code sections
                                                        use this name for link to home page instead of URL
    
    Writing a view
    view()- takes info from request, prepares data needed to generate page, and then sends data back to browser (often using template that defines
                                                                                                                    what page will look like)
    render()- renders response based on data provided by views

    URL request matches pattern -> Djangos looks for index() in views.py-> passes request object to this view function -> render() passes 2 args - original request and template to build page

    Writing a template
    template - defines what a page should look like and Django fills in relevant data each time page is requested
    allows access any data provided by view
