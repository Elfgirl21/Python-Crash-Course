Advantage of functions - separates blocks of code from main program
"""use descriptive names for functions"""
Module - separate file where to store functions, file ending in .py
import - statement that tells python to make the code in a module available in 
    current running program file.
if you use this kind of import statement to import an entire module named module_name.py
    each function in the module is available through the following syntax: module_name.function_name()
importing specific functions
    import specific function from module:
    from module_name import function_name
    also can import as many as you want:
    from module_name import function_0, function_1, function_2
With this syntax, dont have to use dot notation when calling a function

Using as to Give a function an alias
name of function youre importing might conflict w/ an existing name in progrgam
    or function name is too long - use short, unqiue alias -aka nickname for function
    from module_name import function_name as function

Using as to Give a module an alias
giving modules short alias allows you to call the modules functions more quickly
    import module_name as mn
more concise, but helps you focus on the descriptive function names - tell you what each function does
                                                        more important

Importting all functions in a module
from module_name import *
    asterisk in import statement tells python to copy every functions from module_name into the program file
    can call each function by name w/out using dot notation
    HOWEVER, best not to use this approach when working with large modules that you didnt write: if there
    is a module that matches a name in your project == unexpected results
        python will overwrite functions instead of Importting
    BEST APPROACH import function or functions you want, or import the entire module & used dot notation

Styling functions
-descriptive names
    lowercase & underscores
    Modules names should use these conventions as well

-comment that explains what the function does
    immediately ater the function def & use docstring format
    programmers can use it and trust the code if function is well-documented

-specify default value
    no spaces shold be used on either side of equal Sign
    def function_name(parameter_0, parameter_1='dfault value')
    same convention used for keyword args in function calls
    function_name(value_0, parareter_1='value')

-79 characters per line
    def function_name(
            parameter_0, parameter_1, parameter_2,
            parameter_3, parameter_4, parameter_5):

-separate functions by two blank lines

-all import statements should be written at begining of file
