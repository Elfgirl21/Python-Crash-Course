self.screen is called a surface
    surface - in Pygame is a part of the screen where a game element can be displayed
    the surface returned by display.set_mode() represents the entire game window.

    when activate the game's animation loop, this surface will be redrawn on every pass through the loop,
        can be updated w/ any changes triggered by user input

        Event - is action that user perfomrs while playing the game, such as pressing key or moving the mouse
        for program to response to events, we write this event loop to listen for events and perform appropriate tasks
        depending on kinds of events occur. The for loop is a event loop

        to access these events that Pygame detects, used pygame.event.get() function
            returns a list of events that have taken place since the last time this function was called
            any key or mouse event will cause this for loop to run 
            insude loop: series of if statements to detect & repsond to specific events
            EX: when player clicks on game window's close button, pygame.QUIT event is detected
                and we call sys.exit() to exit game

        call pygame.display.flip() tells Pygame to make the most recently drawn screen visible
            erasing old screen so only new screen is visible through each pass through while loop
            when game elements move around, pygame.display.flip() continuall updates the display

        at the end of file created a instance of the game and then called run_game()
        placed run_game() in an if block that only runs if the file is called directly


Colour in Pygame
RGB
Red - (255, 0, 0)
Green - (0, 255, 0)
Blue - (0, 0 , 255)
Light grey - (230, 230, 230)

adding images to game
easiest to use bitmap(.bmp) file b/c Pygame loads bitmaps by default
can configure Pygame to use other file types, some file depend on certain image libraries that must be installed
most files are .jpg or .png - convert them to bitmaps using tools: Photoshop, GIMP, Paint

pay attention to background colour of images. Try to find a transparent or solid background that you can replace with any
background colour using an image editor. Game will look better if the image background matches your game's background. Alternatively, can 
make game background make image background
