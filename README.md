# Python-Crash-Course
Notes and programs made while learning Python.

I spent a month and a half going through this book while writting programs that the book provided. 
I have separated the chapters by folders where I organized the notes, programs by folder. Each folder
has a Tryit folder where I created the challenge programs from scratch and other folders titled by section 
within the chapters.
