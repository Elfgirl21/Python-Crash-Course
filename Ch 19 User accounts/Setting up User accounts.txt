The users App
create a new app, use the startapp command
    make sure to be in project folder before doing this command
creates new directory called users (folder)

Login Page
different from the URL patterns see in learning_logs
using default login view Django provides

import both path and include functions
    include some default authentication URLs that Django has defined
    why we use include function
    
    login page's patter matches URL http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/login/
    Django reads URL, users tells Django to look in users/urls.py
    and login tells it to send requests to Django's default login view

Login template
User requests login page, Django will use default view function but we still need to provide a template
the default autentication views look for templates inside a folder called reistration, so need to create that folder

Note: templae in one app can inherit from a template in another app
if form's errors attribute is set, can display error message
want login view to process the form, set action arg as URL of login page
login view sends form to template and up to use to display the form {{ form.as_p }}
Included a hidden element value set to next to redirect to the home page when user successful logged in.

Linking to the login page
want the login link to appear on every page but don't want it display when user is already logged in, so we nest it inside {% if %}

Django's authentication system
    every template has a user variable available, which always has an is_authenticated attribute set
        the attribute is set to True if user is logged in and False if they aren't. Allows you to display message to authenticated users and
        one to unauthenticated users

Using the login page
make sure to spell things correctly!!!!!

Logging out
Adding a logout link to base.html
    available on every page
default named URL pattern for logging out is simply 'logout'

The logout confirmation page
default logout view renders the page using the template logged_out.html

The Registration page
    using Django's default UserCreationForm but write our own view function and template
the register URL

The register() view function
    needs to display a blank registration form when registration page is first requested and then process completed registration forms when they're submitted
    when registration is successful, function also needs to log in the new user

    import login() to log user in if their registration info is correctly
    import default UserCreationForm

    within register()
    check whether or not dealing with POST request: if not, blank UserCreationForm
    if so, check data is valid - check if username has appropriate characters, passwords match and user isn't trying to do anything malicious in their submission
    if valid, called the form.save() - saves username and hash of the password store to database
    save() method returns a newly created user object, assigned as new_user

The register template
    used as_p method again so Django will display all fields in the form appropriately, including any error messages if form 
    isn't filled out correctly
