spritecollideany() - function takes 2 args: a sprite and a group
    looks for any member of group that has collided with the sprite and stops looking through the group as soon as it finds
    one member that has collided with the sprite

    In Alien Invasion - it loops through the group aliens and returns the 1st alien it finds that has collided with ship

    if no collisions, the function returns None

instead of destorying the ship, count how many times ship been hit.
in game stats module
    call reset_stats() method instead of directly in__init__().
    to set stats properly when GameStats instance is first called
    and any time player starts a new game
