pygame doesn't have a built-in method for making buttons
have to write a class

font.render() - turns text stored in msg into an image, tore it in self.msg_image
    also takes a Boolean value to turn antialiasing on or off
        (antialiasing makes edges of text smoother)
    text font color
    background color - same as button color

starting the game
    MOUSEBUTTONDWN - detects mouse click anywhere on screen
    only on play button for this game

    pygame.mouse.get_pos() - returns a tuple containing the mouse cursor's x & y-coordinates when mouse button clicked

    use rect method collidepoint() to check whether the point of the mouse click overlaps the region deined by Play button's rect

if button_clicked and not self.stats.game_active 
    game restate only if Play button is clicked and game is not currently active
