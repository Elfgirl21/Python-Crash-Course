'functions dont always to have display output directly'
'can return a value or set of values'
'return value - value return by function'
    'allow you to move much of programs grunt work into functions'
'return statement takes value from inside function and sends it back to the line that called function'

optional values allow functions to handle wide range of use cases while letting function calls remain as simple
as possible
