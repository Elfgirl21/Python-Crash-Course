when working with a rect() object
    can use (x,y) of the top, bottom, left and right edges
    when centering
        work with the center game element, centerx, or centery attributes of rect
    when working at edge of screen, 
        work with top, bottom, left or right attributes

    attributes that combine these properties
        midbottom, midtop, midleft, midright

    when adjusting horiontal or vertical placement of rect,
        just use x and y attributes,
        x & y coordinates of its top-left corner

    In Pygame, the origion (0,0) is top-left corner of screen and coordinates increading as you go down and to the right
    on a 1200 by 800, bottom-right corner has coordinate (1200, 800) - refers to the game window, not physical screen
